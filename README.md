#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/kGRtGMWFbh4>

Welcome to the Minesweeper game implemented in Python using the Pygame module! This project serves as the culmination of my endeavors in CS50's Python course, showcasing a comprehensive grasp of fundamental programming concepts and the art of graphical user interface (GUI) development.

## Description

Immerse yourself in the captivating world of Minesweeper, a classic puzzle game where intellectual prowess meets strategic thinking. Your mission is to navigate through a grid littered with hidden mines, employing wit and logic to unearth safe cells while dodging perilous explosives. The grid's numbered hints will be your guiding stars, aiding you in identifying adjacent mines and charting a course to victory. However, beware the erroneous click that could trigger a cataclysmic detonation, terminating your quest.

## Features

- Engaging grid-based gameplay that fuses entertainment with mental agility.
- Left-click functionality unveils cells, while right-clicking strategically plants and removes flags on potential mines.
- Dynamic procedural mine placement ensures each gameplay experience remains refreshingly unique.
- Triumphant achievement is obtained by meticulously uncovering all non-mine cellsâ€”navigate the labyrinthine terrain with care!
- Pygame library employed for its prowess in rendering fluid graphics and orchestrating an intuitive user interface.
